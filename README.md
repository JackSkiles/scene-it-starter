## Welcome to my movie app!

In this app you are able to search movies by name and the page will populate with all related movies.

The movies are retrieved using a free movie data API and then turned into JSON data. The program then uses templete literal JavaScript
to populate only certain elements onto the page, such as the movie poster and title.

You can then add the movie to your local storage with the add favorites, then go to your favorites page where the movies will all load from
local storage.
